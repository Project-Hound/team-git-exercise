# team-git-exercise

This feature navigates through the linked list and retrieved a node at a specific index. It will return data if the index is valid but out of bound, it will return "Index out of range."

Test Case: node = NodeAtIndex(baselinkedlist.l1, 0)

since 0, is being called, it will navigate and retrieve the corresponding index of node, thus it will return Monday. If it is out of bound, it will return index out of range.
