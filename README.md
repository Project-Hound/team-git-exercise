## Search Element

This feature searches the LinkedList to see if there is a specific element. If there is an element, then the result will return true, and vice versa. To use this feature, change the second argument in search_element function to a string. See the below Test Cases for examples.

* Test Case 1:
The feature searches the list for the "Monday" element.
"Monday" element is in the list.
So the result returns True.

* Test Case 2:
The feature searches the list for the "Sunday" element.
"Sunday" element is in the list.
So the result returns False.
